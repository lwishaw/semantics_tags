  <b>As a visual journalist, my 20-year career in journalism has taken me across the United States with stops in Detroit, Dallas and Tacoma.</b>

  <p>My journalism career came from a passion for storytelling and world travel. A path in print design and copy editing led to advancement into production management. These positions have required news judgement, organization, research and collaboration. As the news industry shifted, so did I.</p>
  <p>I love the artistry and detail that goes into creating an informative, socially valuable product. The newsrooms in which I have worked have allowed me to contribute to every step in this process.</p>
  <p>Creating client-focused products for the web is my next career step. My understanding of color, photography, print and online production, and development make me a key player for any of your project needs.</p>    
  <p>I have professional experience with Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign). I know my way around Microsoft Office, Apple software and apps and I've worked with WordPress.</p>
